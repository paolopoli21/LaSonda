The exception message is \u0022Object reference not set to an instance of an object.\u0022 This means that an object reference is null and you are trying to access a member of that object.\n\nThis might be happening because the \u0060monitoringsSignalrRepository\u0060 object is null or the \u0060Clients\u0060 object is null. You can check if these objects are properly initialized before calling the \u0060SendAsync()\u0060 method. You can also check if the \u0060monitoringsSignalrRepository.GetMonitoringList()\u0060 method returns a null value.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can add null checks before calling the \u0060SendAsync()\u0060 method. For example:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060{{C#}}\npublic async Task SendMonitorings()\n{\n    var monitoringList = monitoringsSignalrRepository?.GetMonitoringList();\n    if (monitoringList != null \u0026\u0026 Clients != null)\n    {\n        await Clients.All.SendAsync(\u0022getmonitoringhub\u0022, monitoringList);\n    }\n}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThis code uses the null-conditional operator (\u0060?.\u0060) to check if the \u0060monitoringsSignalrRepository\u0060 object is null before calling the \u0060GetMonitoringList()\u0060 method. It also checks if the \u0060Clients\u0060 object is null before calling the \u0060SendAsync()\u0060 method. \n\nIf this fix does not solve the issue, you can provide more information about the \u0060monitoringsSignalrRepository\u0060 object and the \u0060Clients\u0060 object, such as their initialization code and where they are used in the application.","Type":0,"Status":1,"FollowUpPrompts":["How can I check if the Clients object is null?","Can you explain more about the null-conditional operator?"]},"SelectedFunctionName":"ExplainException","LoggedSkillInvocations":null}
